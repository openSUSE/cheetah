Cheetah
=======

Cheetah is a simple library for executing external commands safely and
conveniently.

Examples
--------

```ruby
# Run a command and capture its output
files = Cheetah.run("ls", "-la", :capture => :stdout)

# Run a command and handle errors
begin
  Cheetah.run("rm", "/etc/passwd")
rescue Cheetah::ExecutionFailed => e
  puts e.message
  puts "Standard output: #{e.stdout}"
  puts "Error ouptut:    #{e.stderr}"
end
```

Features
--------

  * Easy passing of command input
  * Easy capturing of command output (standard, error, or both)
  * 100% secure (shell expansion is impossible by design)
  * Raises exceptions on errors (no more manual status code checks)
  * Optional logging for easy debugging

Non-features
------------

  * Handling of interactive commands

Installation
------------

    $ gem install cheetah

Usage
-----

First, require the library:

```ruby
require "cheetah"
```

You can now use the `Cheetah.run` method to run commands, pass them an input and
capture their output:

```ruby
# Run a command with arguments
Cheetah.run("tar", "xzf", "foo.tar.gz")

# Pass an input (as a string)
Cheetah.run("python", :stdin => source_code)

# Pass an input (as a stream)
File.open("huge_program.py") do |stdin|
  Cheetah.run("python", :stdin => stdin)
end

# Capture standard output
files = Cheetah.run("ls", "-la", :capture => :stdout)

# Capture both standard and error output
results, errors = Cheetah.run("grep", "-r", "User", ".", :capture => [ :stdout, :stderr ])

# Capture standard output into a stream
File.open("files.txt") do |stdout|
  Cheetah.run("ls", "-la", :stdout => stdout)
end
```

If the command can't be executed for some reason or returns a non-zero exit
status, the method raises an exception with detailed information about the
failure:

```ruby
# Run a command and handle errors
begin
  Cheetah.run("rm", "/etc/passwd")
rescue Cheetah::ExecutionFailed => e
  puts e.message
  puts "Standard output: #{e.stdout}"
  puts "Error ouptut:    #{e.stderr}"
end
```

For debugging purposes, you can also use a logger. Cheetah will log the command,
its status, input and both outputs to it. By default, the `Logger::INFO` level
will be used for normal messages and the `Logger::ERROR` level for messages
about errors (non-zero exit status or non-empty error output), but this can be
changed if needed:

```ruby
# Log the execution
Cheetah.run("ls -l", :logger => logger)

# Change levels of logged messages
Cheetah.run("ls -l",
  :logger             => logger,
  :logger_level_info  => Logger::DEBUG,
  :logger_level_error => Logger::WARN
)
```

To avoid repetition, you can set global default value of any option passed too
`Cheetah.run`:

```ruby
# If you're tired of passing the :logger option all the time...
Cheetah.default_options = { :logger = my_logger }
Cheetah.run("./configure")
Cheetah.run("make")
Cheetah.run("make", "install")
Cheetah.default_options = {}
```

For more information, see the
[API documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/openSUSE/cheetah/frames).

Compatibility
-------------

Cheetah should run well on any Unix system with Ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.3. Non-Unix
systems and different Ruby implementations/versions may work too but they were
not tested.
